# Opencv-android-SDK-3.3.1-with-opencl-and-contrib
This Repo contains 'openCVLibrary android library' which is built for android with contrib and opencl enabled. 
Default opencv android SDK don't provide this so I have build this custom one from opencv 3.3.1.
Make sure you use NDK bundle upto 13B , as android has made some changes in later version of NDK which doesn't support opencv build commands.
